/**
 * @dev DeedHolder provides a way for owners of ENS deeds to restrict their
 *      ability to make changes to a name they own. Once ownership of a deed is
 *      transferred to DeedHolder, the original owner may not do anything with
 *      the deed other than transfer ownership to another account until the
 *      registrar is upgraded, at which point they may claim back ownership of
 *      the deed. The transfer function allows owners to precommit to an upgrade
 *      path before the new registrar is deployed.
 *      Designed to be used with the initially deployed ENS and
 *      HashRegistrarSimplified contracts.
