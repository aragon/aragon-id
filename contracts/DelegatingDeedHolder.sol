 * A deed holder that allows the current owner of the deed to set a "manager" for the held ENS node.

 * administrative tasks. Managers do not have to be permanent; they can return control of the ENS
 * node back to this deed holder to allow a new manager to be later set.
 *
 * This extra layer over the DeedHolder allows one to control how the ENS node is managed after
 * transferring their deed ownership to a DeedHolder, as the initial transfer of the deed to the
 * DeedHolder also transfers control of the ENS node.
